## Why symupy?

The objective of `symupy` is to bring traffic data into the python world so that all tools available in the data science ecosystem  are available for you. Traffic flow simulators are already available in the market, the objective with this package is to be able to deploy simulations with microscopic open source solutions such as ['SymuFlow'](http://github.com/licit-lab/symuflow).
